# Introduction

These are the components that I have created. They are all in react-tsx and the goal is so that I can copy the code and reuse them 😉, it is definitely not an attempt to create a new framework.

I will be cataloging these components with <a href="https://storybook.js.org/"><img className="logo" src={Storybook}/></a> and deploying it with <a href="https://vercel.com/"><img src={Vercel} alt="vercel" className="logo" /></a>

# Installation

If you want to copy, read or use it, simply clone it by using the following code. 👌

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Diorla/web-components
```
