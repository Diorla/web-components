# Introduction

These are the components that I have created. They are all in react-tsx and the goal is so that I can copy the code and reuse them, it is definitely not an attempt to create a new framework.

# Installation

If you want to copy, read or use it, simply clone it by using the following code.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Diorla/web-components
```

If you have any issue or suggestion, please let me know. I'm open to learning and improving as a programmer.
